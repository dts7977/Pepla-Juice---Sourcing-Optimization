PepLa Juice Blending
An analyst at PepLa has been asked to prepare a plan for the procurement of orange juice from
its suppliers to meet the demand of January, February, and March of the coming year. The
forecasted demand is provided below.
Quantities and quality of oranges vary from year to year. In order to produce consistently
delicious orange juice, PepLa procures its juice from 11 suppliers worldwide located in the US,
Brazil, India, China, Spain, Mexcio, Egypt and Italy. The juices are shipped from the suppliers to
the blending facility of PepLa in Florida. 

The analyst is aware of an agreement that PepLa signed with the state of Florida, which requires
PepLa to buy at least 35% of its juice from its Florida supplier each month. This agreement
allows PepLa to receive tax incentives and should not be violated under any circumstances.

Build a linear programming model to find the minimum cost procurement plan.

The analyst prepared a plan based on your model, and submitted the report to executives of
PepLa. One feedback the analyst received back from the executives is whether it is possible to
reduce the cost further (comparing to the minimum cost obtained from the first part) by 5%?
What would you do?
